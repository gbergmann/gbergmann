Hello!

I’m an early career microbial ecologist. As a PhD candidate at the University of California-Davis, I study the ecological processes that contribute to microbial transmission from flowers to seeds. I’m currently learning spatial analysis and multivariate analysis of microbial community data, and will learn how to apply neutral models to community data in the future. If you're interested in my work, you can get in touch with me at gbergmann@ucdavis.edu, or learn more about my research at gebergmann.weebly.com!
