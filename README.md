Hello!

I’m an early career microbial ecologist currently working as Postdoctoral Researcher of Seed Microbiomes and Bioinformatics at ATB Potsdam. My projects involve multivariate analyses of microbial community data, including differential abundance analysis, comparing empirical data to neutral models and some spatial analyses. If you're interested in my work, you can get in touch with me at gbergmann@atb-potsdam.de, or learn more about my research at gebergmann.weebly.com!
