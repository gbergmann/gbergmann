- 👋 Hi, I’m @gbergmann
- 👀 I’m interested in seed microbial ecology. As a PhD student at the University of California-Davis, I study the ecological processes that contribute to microbial transmission from flowers to seeds. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: spatial analysis and multivariate analysis of microbiome data, optimizing figure design (R). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: spatial statistics, applying null models to community data. 
- 📫 How to reach me: gbergmann@ucdavis.edu, or learn more about my work at gebergmann.weebly.com!
