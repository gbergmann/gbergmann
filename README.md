Hello!

I’m an early career microbial ecologist. As a PhD candidate at the University of California-Davis, I study the ecological processes that contribute to microbial transmission from flowers to seeds. My projects involve multivariate analyses of microbial community data, including differential abundance analysis, comparing empirical data to neutral models and some spatial analyses. If you're interested in my work, you can get in touch with me at gbergmann@ucdavis.edu, or learn more about my research at gebergmann.weebly.com!
